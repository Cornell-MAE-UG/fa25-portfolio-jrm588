For this portfolio project, I designed a 2D lifting mechanism within the 150 cm by 50 cm workspace using two fixed ground pins, a moving pin, and a linear actuator. The goal was to maximize the lifted weight and height achievable by the system. I chose a commercial actuator with a peak thrust of 3 kN and configured a simple A–B–C linkage so the actuator applied force at a shallow angle to increase the mechanical advantage. Using static equilibrium and moment balance about the ground pin, I derived a relationship between actuator force and output load, showing that the lift force increases with smaller actuator angles. I used trigonometric relationships to determine the geometry of the linkage and verified that the structure remained rigid and well-supported. The resulting design efficiently converts actuator thrust into vertical lift, allowing the mechanism to raise the maximum possible load to the greatest possible height within the given space constraints.
