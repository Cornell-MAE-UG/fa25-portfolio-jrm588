My name is Jawad Mohamed, and I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. I’m passionate about applying engineering principles to design, test, and optimize mechanical systems that push the boundaries of performance and innovation. My interests span across areas such as automotive design, mechanical testing, and system integration, where I enjoy combining hands-on prototyping with analytical problem-solving. Whether I’m working on precision testing rigs, refining CAD models, or collaborating with teammates on high-performance vehicle systems, I’m driven by curiosity, precision, and a commitment to engineering excellence.
